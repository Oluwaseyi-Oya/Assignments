Hello and Welcome to our Guessing Game.
You initially start with 50 LIFE POINTS.
For Every Wrong Guess -10 LIFE POINTS.
For Every Time You use a HINT - 5 LIFE POINTS.
For Every 5 correct guesses + 5 LIFE POINTS.
You can see your current SCORE and LIFE POINTS after every guess.
You can see your position on our LeaderBoard after playing the game.
GOOD LUCK !
